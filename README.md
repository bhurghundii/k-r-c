# k-r-c
learning c through k&amp;r

## here lies my attempt to git gud at C 

### why did i do this?
k&r is pretty much viewed as the standard for C and i liked C when i did it at uni - its simple. 
it also goes over some really fantastic under the hood stuff like how memory management works, how your favorite unix commands are done up and how data structures like hashmaps are done using pointers and stuff.

**it also has the best explanation for pointers ive ever encountered - skip to chapter 5 for it** 

## how did i do it 

i just read the book and did the excercises whenever i could. its a book i will revisit more i think! 

# waypointing for lost souls 

i read the digital version off this github repo: https://github.com/MTJailed/C-Programming-Books/blob/master/The%20ANSI%20C%20Programming%20Language.pdf

my mac didnt always pick up on the text as i tried copying things out. 
the book is full of gold, but also outdated (getline is now a standard lib thing)

the CLC wiki is full of examples and answers typed out: https://clc-wiki.net/wiki/C_tutorial 
this repo is also full of typed out examples too: https://github.com/caisah/K-and-R-exercises-and-examples/tree/913d6427cd397aeaf649e839ceb77ef5d5e75a61
